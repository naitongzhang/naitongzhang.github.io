Today marks the final day of the rental contract for the house in Beijing's Bowstring Alley, a place I left several months ago. The house holds significant sentimental value as my wife had renovated it approximately seven years ago. Despite having no savings at the time, she managed to borrow money from her siblings and parents, dedicating months of effort and a total of 60,000 RMB to transform the house into a beautiful space. Bowstring Alley itself is located just a few hundred meters away from the Forbidden City and a few kilometers from the Middle South Sea.

One intriguing resident who used to live in this alley was Mr. Li, the chairman's doctor. He gained fame for writing a book about his experiences living alongside the chairman. Unfortunately, Mr. Li's departure from his homeland ended in tragedy, as he sadly passed away shortly after completing his first book.

"what makes a person leave his homeland?" I asked the question to ChatGPT and its answer is given below:

"There are several factors that can lead a person to leave their homeland. Here are some possible reasons:
Economic opportunities: Economic reasons are one of the main drivers for people leaving their homeland. Sometimes, individuals may be unable to find suitable job opportunities or receive adequate salaries in their own country, and they may choose to seek better economic prospects and living standards in other countries.
Political persecution: Political persecution is another significant reason that prompts people to leave their homeland. In some countries, governments may persecute specific groups or individuals, restrict freedom of speech, religion, or political liberties. Such persecution may force people to leave their country in order to protect their safety and freedom.
War and conflict: War and conflict are major factors that drive people to leave their homeland. Wars can result in widespread destruction, violence, and humanitarian crises, compelling individuals to leave their homes and seek safety and refuge elsewhere.
Education and academic opportunities: Some people leave their homeland to pursue better education and academic opportunities. They may choose to study in schools or universities in other countries to gain broader knowledge and access better educational resources.
Family and personal reasons: Family and personal reasons can also lead people to leave their homeland. For example, an individual may choose to leave their hometown for family reunification, pursuing romantic relationships, or seeking personal growth.
It's important to note that the reasons for leaving one's homeland can vary from person to person. Some individuals may have a single reason, while others may be influenced by multiple factors. Additionally, leaving one's homeland is a complex personal decision that involves various personal considerations and trade-offs."

Later it gave seveal general examples:

"Here are some more general examples of people leaving their homeland:
During World War II, many Jewish individuals fled their homelands in Europe and sought refuge in countries like the United States, Canada, and South American nations to escape persecution and the Holocaust.
In recent times, there has been a significant influx of Pakistani and Indian migrants moving to Arabic countries such as the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, and Qatar. These individuals often seek better employment opportunities, higher wages, and improved living standards.
Following the collapse of the Soviet Union, many Russians migrated to various countries around the world. Some sought economic opportunities in Western Europe and the United States, while others relocated to neighboring countries or former Soviet republics for cultural or family ties.
These examples highlight historical and contemporary instances of individuals leaving their homelands due to a variety of reasons, such as seeking safety during times of conflict or persecution, pursuing economic prospects in foreign countries, or exploring cultural and family connections."
"Here are some additional general examples of people leaving their homeland:
In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, millions of Europeans migrated to the United States, Canada, Australia, and South America in search of better economic opportunities and a chance for a new beginning. This wave of migration included individuals from countries such as Ireland, Italy, Germany, and Poland.
In the 1950s and 1960s, many people from former colonies in Africa and Asia moved to European countries, particularly the United Kingdom, France, and the Netherlands, seeking employment and a higher standard of living.
In recent years, there has been an increase in the number of Venezuelans leaving their country due to political and economic turmoil. Many have migrated to neighboring countries such as Colombia, Peru, and Ecuador, as well as other nations in the region, in search of stability, work opportunities, and access to basic necessities.
The Syrian refugee crisis, which began in 2011 due to the civil war, has led millions of Syrians to flee their homeland and seek refuge in neighboring countries such as Turkey, Lebanon, and Jordan, as well as European nations. These individuals are escaping violence, destruction, and the collapse of basic services in their home country.
In the late 1970s and early 1980s, thousands of Vietnamese refugees fled their homeland following the Vietnam War. Many sought asylum in countries such as the United States, Canada, Australia, and France, escaping political persecution and the aftermath of the conflict. "

The above explanations have thoroughly answered my queries. It is a natural thing for people to move from one place to another for survival. However, to some extent, I still feel that something is missing. What is it? Events and worsening conditions can surely trigger migration, but before that, the falling expectations of a country should also be considered. When we consider the stock market, we all know that there is a β factor. If the market is good, the stock will perform well because it fluctuates with the market. The same principle applies to individuals and countries. Will the country be good? If it is not supposed to be, then people should think about moving.

During the 1990s, the whole world was focusing on China. After several years of reform and openness, the world saw China's determination to change and a promising future ahead. My family also started a shop in the 1990s. Under diligent management, the conditions gradually improved throughout the 2000s. After China joined the WTO in 2003, Chinese small manufacturers, especially those in Zhejiang Province, experienced significant growth. This positive momentum deeply influenced the mindset of the Chinese people, fostering the belief that "things will get better."

University of Nottingham Ningbo Campus, which was inaugurated by the President in 2006. Initially, a majority of its graduates pursued further studies overseas and joined foreign-owned enterprises in China. During my undergraduate years in 2012, Premier Wen visited the school and expressed the hope that students would keep their homeland in mind while having a global perspective to contribute to China's globalization efforts.

In 2013, the President announced the Belt and Road Initiative. I still vividly remember the immense hope and optimism surrounding this initiative, even though there were no concrete plans or actions in place at that time. Following my graduation, I joined a Chinese construction firm in 2015, becoming part of the force driving global expansion. Over time, the plan became clearer, with State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs) building the platform and assisting Chinese privately-owned enterprises (POEs) to participate in it. The majority of SOEs operate in the infrastructure industry, while most POEs are engaged in manufacturing and exporting.

In 2015, I was sent to Pakistan as an expatriate. When I left in 2018, my career aspiration was still to become a charismatic global manager in a Chinese firm. At that time, China was experiencing its prime time, and there was a prevailing belief that China and its people were among the wealthiest in the world. Billions of dollars were being invested in Asia, Africa, Latin America, and other regions. Chinese individuals were actively purchasing education, luxury goods, and services from around the world. The "eastern sun" was rising.

The outcome of global expansion is often presented by officials in a positive light, while disregarding the negative aspects. Taking the example of Pakistan, a country that has received support from China for several decades, we can compare a country to a seed. If the seed is of good quality, it will thrive even in difficult circumstances. However, if the seed is of poor quality, it will eventually perish, despite receiving ample resources. If a country has a strong foundation, good governance, and sustainable policies, external support can contribute to its growth and development even in challenging circumstances. However, if there are underlying issues such as corruption, weak institutions, or ineffective governance, external aid may not lead to sustainable progress and can even exacerbate existing problems.

In the case of China's free loans to Pakistan, while the loans may have provided temporary relief and sustained the country's functioning, they may have also perpetuated a cycle of dependency and allowed corrupt politicians to maintain their power. The lack of transparency and accountability in such arrangements can undermine the long-term interests of the country and its citizens. It is not uncommon for complex stories to emerge behind large-scale projects and international agreements, including allegations of bribery, questionable deals, and hidden interests. It is conceivable that more high-ranking Chinese officials will eventually break free from the system and escape its control. As time goes on, more stories beyond the mainstream narrative may come to light.

Even towards the end of 2021, I was pursuing my MBA degree and still had some confidence in the country. However, the following year changed everything. Totalitarianism showed little concern for the welfare of its people; it cared only about maintaining its power. Many individuals believed that it was reminiscent of the Cultural Revolution, prompting them to question the direction in which we were heading.

Compared to the rest of the world, we have chosen a completely independent path, leading us to be isolated from global engagement. While it might be true that there are different approaches to achieving prosperity, are there any fundamental principles that we should adhere to? For instance, should we value the rights of individuals and establish checks and balances within the governance system? From my experience in the construction industry over the past several years, I have learned that a successful project requires collaboration between engineers and consultants. It involves both building and verifying, with one side dedicated to construction and the other side focused on quality control and oversight. Besides, throughout the world, over thousands of years of development, people's rights have been increasingly protected by laws and societal structures. Criticism of the government has become commonplace in the modern world.

I have had no contact with high-level officials, but recent personal experiences have prompted me to reflect on these matters. One such experience was my visit to an old town called Jiming Posthouse at the beginning of 2023. The virus had recently impacted everyone, and very few visitors were coming to this tourist site. Many aspects of the site were abandoned, even though people still lived there. They seemed to lack the motivation to improve their deteriorating living conditions. Their existence relied solely on waiting and seeking assistance from the Communist Party, which had constructed the most beautiful house in the old town for its own use. What has led to this situation? It appears that entrepreneurs are hesitant to invest, possibly due to a lack of confidence in the protection of their personal assets. When leaders repeatedly retract and release policies based on their own judgments, it erodes people's faith in justice and rules, significantly undermining governance efficiency.

The second experience involves my wife's pregnancy. She registered at the Dong Cheng District Maternal and Child Health Hospital and encountered doctors with varying levels of dedication to their profession and ethical responsibilities. Some doctors fulfilled their duties admirably, prioritizing patient care. However, others displayed little interest in patients and were more concerned about pleasing leaders and avoiding complaints. When we arrived in Shenzhen, we received exceptional service at the public hospital, surpassing our expectations. The level of care, facilities, and overall environment were comfortable. China is economically divided into two parts, with the South outperforming the North. This discrepancy can be attributed to the market reforms that have taken place in Shenzhen. The lack of respect for natural market rules and limited developmental opportunities for the people contribute to this disparity.

The third experience involves applying for heat supply for my house. Since I didn't anticipate using the house during the upcoming winter, I requested a heat stop. The staff from the heat company inspected the house and presented only one solution: completely revamping the heat supply system from the bottom to the top, which would require significant structural modifications. I declined their proposal and suggested a minor modification that I was willing to pay for, but my request went unheard. It seems that customer opinions are disregarded because customers are seen as insignificant. This situation arises from a lack of respect for people's rights under the regime.

The last but certainly not the least, diversity is a concept that I learned about a decade ago and continue to deepen my understanding of. Diversity goes beyond the notion of human rights and equality; it is crucial for the overall well-being of society. Embracing different values in a society allows individuals to have their own choices and preferences. Each value system can coexist, respect one another, and engage in healthy competition to achieve greater heights and progress. In many ways, diversity has proven beneficial for the development of Chinese cities.

In the northern part of China, there is only one dominant center, Beijing, which often exhibits a rigid and lifeless environment, comparable to a steel plate. However, in the Yangtze River Delta and the Pearl River Delta regions, there are multiple centers that thrive with diversity. These regions are characterized by a multitude of people who embrace different values, and as a result, they organically work towards a common prosperity. The presence of various perspectives, ideas, and approaches fuels innovation and dynamic growth in these areas.

We have indeed entered a new era where the dynamics of global power and economic influence are shifting. ASEAN countries are on the rise, Mexico is experiencing a promising period, and India has become the world's most populous nation, reminding us of the stories of the previous largest population country. In the Middle East, countries are fiercely competing with each other for their place in the global landscape.

If we examine the recent economic data, it becomes evident that China stands at a crossroads. Some have been predicting for years that China's manufacturing would migrate elsewhere, and the current unemployment rate in China may be a harsh reality check. While China may be too big to fall, its people may endure prolonged suffering.

What can be done? The rough advice for the governing regime is to stop pretending to be good and instead focus on practical measures to improve people's lives. An important aspect to consider is the government's ability to provide attractive living conditions and social services to its population. Many countries around the world have failed to provide decent social services, presenting an opportunity for China, as a monopoly in providing such services, to create an inviting living environment and attract people from other nations. This approach could address both the challenges of an aging population and overall development. However, foreigners are not currently considering China as their preferred destination, with many choosing Southeast Asia instead.

For individuals, it is essential to reduce reliance on country-specific knowledge and instead focus on accumulating professional expertise that empowers them to thrive in different countries. If you find that your current country does not suit your needs, you can have the option to seek a better life elsewhere. In recent years, we have witnessed countries breaking down, with labor's wages barely supporting basic survival. By staying in such circumstances, you not only waste your own potential but also hinder progress for the rest of the world. As the saying goes, "A tree that does not move dies, but people who keep moving stay alive." Ultimately, it is challenging to predict where the winds of change will lead.

Having worked on Chinese globalization, I have observed that many Chinese people are engaged in this business. However, engaging in globalization solely to meet the demands of nationalism and belittle others does not align with the true spirit of globalization. It is important to recognize that genuine globalization requires more than just economic expansion or promoting national interests. It necessitates a deeper understanding and appreciation of diverse cultures, perspectives, and values.

To truly achieve globalization, it is essential for individuals to spend time in other countries, interact with people from different backgrounds, and immerse themselves in diverse environments. This allows for a broader perspective and a more comprehensive understanding of the world. By embracing global experiences, individuals can develop empathy, cultural sensitivity, and the ability to collaborate with people from various backgrounds, thus transcend the limitations of being "blind to the world." This enables them to contribute positively to global conversations, understand the aspirations and concerns of others, and ultimately earn the respect of people from different regions, including those in Hong Kong.

After all these years, China remains China, and the world remains the world. The walls between them may even seem higher now. While China's renaissance may hold significance for its leaders, the normal Chinese people might need to think about what is truly matter for them. The path forward for ordinary people may be long, arduous, and filled with crises.
